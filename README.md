Description
The GUI for the Recipe Manager application was enhanced to improve usability and 
functionality. The layout was optimized with clear buttons for adding, displaying, scaling, and 
deleting recipes, making navigation more intuitive and user-friendly. Filtering functionality was 
added, allowing users to narrow down recipes based on specific criteria: ingredient name, food 
group, and maximum calories. These filters can be used individually or in combination, 
providing a versatile way to find recipes that meet specific dietary preferences. These changes 
significantly enhance the application's usability, making it easier for users to manage and find 
recipes efficiently. Additionally, the application ensures all previous functions are still available.
Recipes are displayed in alphabetical order in both the full list and filtered results, facilitating 
quick location of specific recipes. A calorie warning feature was also implemented to alert users 
when the total calories of a recipe exceed 300, helping users make more informed dietary 
choices. These changes significantly enhance the application's usability, making it easier for 
users to manage and find recipes efficiently.
